Perl Simple Gallery Generator v 0.1
==============================================

Requirements
------------------------

Perl modules
 * Image::ExifTool
   http://search.cpan.org/~exiftool/Image-ExifTool-8.15/
 * AppConfig
   http://search.cpan.org/~abw/AppConfig/
 * Getopt::Long (shipped with perl5->)
   http://search.cpan.org/~jv/Getopt-Long-2.38/

Programs:
 * convert from ImageMagick
   http://www.imagemagick.org/
 * jhead
   http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/

And, of course you probably want to publish whis on
a Web server. The generated result is static HTML,
so no requirements at all exist in regard to type
and functionality of HTTP daemon.


Installation
-------------------------

* Place the navigation JavaScript and the CSS file
somewhere convenient on your Web server.

* Place the template files (index.tpl, full.tpl)
where You want, I prefer having them located in
/usr/loca/share/plsgen

* Place the executable script so that execution
is practical. I place it as /usr/local/bin/plsgen so 
that I have it in my search path.

* Take a look at the shipped configuration file.
plsgen looks for a config file as /etc/plsgen.cfg,
as ./plsgen.cfg or ../plgen.cfg relative to where
it is executed. Alternatively, the --config option
allows you to override the default locations.
The shipped config lists all configuration options,
along with their default values (used if no config present).


Execution / Use
-------------------------

plsgen is written to be ececuted in a directory filled
with image files, and will create all its data
in this directory. The resulting album will list
all present image files of types JPG, PNG and GIF.
A display-size and thumbnail image will be created
for each image, and will be stored in the sub-directories
view and thumbs (respectively).

Recognized commandline options are:
    --title='Your album title'
        Sets the album title. Title will be stored in .title
        If no title is given, it will be read from .title, if present
    --htmlonly
        Add this option to only generate HTML files
        No image operations will be performed with this option
    --noexif
        Forces EXIF data block not to be written to HTML output
    --config=/path/to/config
        Overrides default config file location.
        Default is to look for ./plsgen.cfg, then ../plsgen.cfg
        and finally /etc/plsgen.cfg.
     --help
        Displays a list of available commandline options


File overrides: comments, title, index image.
------------------------------------------------------
plsgen supports static gallery- and image comments. To get descriptive
text or author comments on a gallery, add a file with the name 'comment.txt'
to the directory before generating the album. The file is read, and injected
verbatim, into all index* files generated, pre- and post-padded with the
content of the comment-{pre,post} configuration variables.

To add an image comment, create a text file named identically to the image 
filename, plus the suffix .txt. So, if an image is named 'AnImage.JPG', the
corresponding comment file should be named 'AnImage.JPG.txt'

If you wish to pre-seed the gallery title, you may do so by putting the
gallery title on a single line in a file named '.title'. The title is read
from this file if no title is given on the command line, and it is present.
Note that if a title is given on the command line, that title will be used,
and also will overwrite any content in the .title file.

A reference to an "index image", simply the first image in the set,
is saved in the file '.indeximage', if this file does not previously exist.
To override the chosen index image, simply put the filename you would
rather have used in this file. The index image is used bu the included
example index.php and rss.php


Index front-end and RSS support
-------------------------
Included is a sample front-end index, and an accompanying RSS
generator written using PHP. To use these, take a look at the PHP
source, make personal adaptation (at least change references to my site
to your own), and place both php files, plus indexstyle.css in a
directory where you keep your albums as sub-directories.

E.g.:
  Web Root
  |-- galleryset1
  |   |-- image1.jpg
  |   |-- image1.jpg.txt
  |   |-- image2.jpg
  |   |-- comment.txt
  |    `- .title
  |-- galleryset2
  .     ...
  |-- nav.js
  |-- style.css
  |-- index.php
  |-- indexstyle.css
   `- rss.php


Todo-list

# TODO: Templating of EXIF
# TODO: Priority/sorting of EXIF tags
# TODO: Possibility for hide/show EXIF
# TODO: Clear old generated files and meta on regen
# TODO: Use perlmagick et. al instead of convert/jhead..
