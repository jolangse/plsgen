Perl Simple Gallery Generator v 0.1
==============================================

Requirements
------------------------

Perl modules
 * Image::ExifTool
   http://search.cpan.org/~exiftool/Image-ExifTool-8.15/
 * AppConfig
   http://search.cpan.org/~abw/AppConfig/
 * Getopt::Long (shipped with perl5->)
   http://search.cpan.org/~jv/Getopt-Long-2.38/

Programs:
 * convert from ImageMagick
   http://www.imagemagick.org/
 * jhead
   http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/

And, of course you probably want to publish whis on
a Web server. The generated result is static HTML,
so no requirements at all exist in regard to type
and functionality of HTTP daemon.

Installation
-------------------------

* Place the navigation JavaScript and the CSS file
somewhere convenient on your Web server.

* Place the template files (index.tpl, full.tpl)
where You want, I prefer having them located in
/usr/loca/share/plsgen

* Place the executable script so that execution
is practical. I place it as /usr/local/bin/plsgen so 
that I have it in my search path.

* Take a look at the shipped configuration file.
plsgen looks for a config file as /etc/plsgen.cfg,
as ./plsgen.cfg or ../plgen.cfg relative to where
it is executed. Alternatively, the --config option
allows you to override the default locations.
The shipped config lists all configuration options,
along with their default values (used if no config present).

Execution / Use
-------------------------

plsgen is written to be ececuted in a directory filled
with image files, and will create all its data
in this directory. The resulting album will list
all present image files of types JPG, PNG and GIF.
A display-size and thumbnail image will be created
for each image, and will be stored in the sub-directories
view and thumbs (respectively).

Recognized commandline options are:
    --title='Your album title'
        Sets the album title. Title will be stored in .title
        If no title is given, it will be read from .title, if present
    --htmlonly
        Add this option to only generate HTML files
        No image operations will be performed with this option
    --config=/path/to/config
        Overrides default config file location.
        Default is to look for ./plsgen.cfg, then ../plsgen.cfg
        and finally /etc/plsgen.cfg.
     --help
        Displays a list of available commandline options

Todo-list
